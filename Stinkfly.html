        <h1>He is Stinkfly</h1>

        <h2><u>Abour Stinkfly</u></h2>
        <p>Stinkfly, a Lepidopterran, ties with Wildmutt for the least humanoid of all the Ben 10 aliens. However, Stinkfly also had some advantages that made him much more useful. For one, he was capable of human speech, even if Ben Tennyson's voice did come out distorted through his mandibles. Even better, and as his name implies, Stinkfly could take flight, making him much more useful than Ripjaws.<br>

            While his fragile insectoid frame left him physically weak, he made up for this with speed and his ability to shoot an acidic substance. The specific function of this liquid would vary depending on the situation â€” it could do anything from holding huge objects to lighting things on fire. His only major weaknesses were his wings, which were not as durable as the rest of his body. As such, Stinkfly cannot be ranked any higher on this list.</p>
