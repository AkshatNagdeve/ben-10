        <p>â€‹Wildmutt was Ben's most bestial form. This Ben 10 alien was the Omnitrix sample of a Vulpimancer, an eyeless canid species with porcupine quills. Despite his fearsome appearance, Wildmutt's greatest strength lay in his enhanced senses, particularly his olfactory abilities. Although the lack of eyes prevents him from fighting on par with the strongest villains, Wildmutt can easily locate invisible enemies with his smell.</p>
