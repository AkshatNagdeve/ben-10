        <h2><u>Abour XLR8</u></h2>
        <p>In a series like Ben 10, good old-fashioned coolness matters a lot, and <u>XLR8</u> was always the coolest of the Ben 10 aliens. As his name implies, XLR8, a member of the Kineceleran species, possessed incredible superspeed. This meant XLR8 was not only plenty useful in a fight â€” in many ways, this Omnitrix alien was the most useful for practical, everyday purposes. <br>

            Though he's the most fragile of the original Ben 10 aliens apart from Stinkfly, XLR8's speed makes up for this weakness by being untouchable. In fact, he could accelerate at such high rates that even time seemed to slow down. Like Four Arms, this alien form also grew more powerful as it got older. Combine that with his awesome visual, and XLR8 is the clear victor for the title of best Ben 10 alien.</p>
