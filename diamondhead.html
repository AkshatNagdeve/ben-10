        <p>Diamondhead is a Petrosapien, a silicon-based life-form with a body composed of crystals as hard as diamonds. Of all the Ben 10 original aliens, his super-strength and durability ranked second only to Four Arms. However, Diamondhead surpassed Four Arms due to his extra abilities. Diamondhead could reshape his body, form weapons from his limbs, launch smaller crystals as projectiles, or create new crystal constructs altogether. <br>

            Furthermore, he could generate crystals from underground, allowing him to make barriers, walls, or even extended limbs. Diamondhead also had the power to trap foes within his crystal constructs, although stronger enemies could break out easily. In the sequel series Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben even used Diamondhead to soundly defeat Vilgax, one of his deadliest foes.</p>
