        <h1>He is Upgrade</h1>

        <h2><u>Abour Upgrade</u></h2>
        <p>Diamondhead isn't the only inorganic alien in the Omnitrix. <u>Upgrade</u>, a Galvanic Mechamorph, was composed of nano-machines that formed a vaguely humanoid blob with a cyclopean head. As such, the green-and-black grid lines along his body indicated his technological origins. Upgrade's technological nature reflected his most useful power, technopathy, the ability to possess machines and alter them to his will.<br>

            For more direct fighting, his viscous body granted him superhuman flexibility, and he could also shoot a powerful laser beam from his single eye. Upgrade was special because he could possess any kind of machine, even those that don't rely on electricity. Finally, this Ben 10 original alien had the ability to upgrade his technopathic tech, transforming them beyond their actual purpose.</p>
