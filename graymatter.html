        <p>Being a 10-year-old boy, Ben was anything but a model of maturity and strategic thinking. That made Grey Matter his least favorite of the Ben 10 original aliens. This form was the Omnitrix sample of a Galvan â€” a 6-inch tall, physically feeble species that was also gifted with super-intelligence. Grey Matter's intellect allowed him to craft highly refined technology and perform delicate renovation projects that nobody else was capable of.<br>

            Ben often transformed into Grey Matter as a result of the Omnitrix's frequent glitches, but the alien's intelligence still helped him save the day. In "Ken 10," Ben's son even uses Grey Matter's intelligence to unlock the master control in his own Omnitrix. Ben becomes considerably smarter when using Grey Matter, helping him comprehend concepts far beyond his human capacity..<br>
