        <h2><u>Abour Heatblast</u></h2>
        <p>In the Ben 10 series premiere "And Then There Were 10," Heatblast was the first alien that Ben transformed into. The Omnitrix's sample of the Pyronite species, Heatblast was essentially a humanoid being made of living magma. Heatblast more than lived up to Ben's name for him and practically exploded with fire whenever he wanted to. He usually manifested this attack in the form of fireballs, but Heatblast could also release flames from his mouth. <BR>

            As a bonus, Heatblast's pyrokinesis let him fly using combustive force, making him one of the fastest Ben 10 aliens. Another major advantage was his ability to quench fires and absorb heat, allowing Ben to perform rescue missions when necessary. The one drawback was that Ben couldn't always control the heat this form generated, although a little practice went a long way.</p>
