        <h2><u>Abour Four arms</u></h2>
        <p>Although Ben disdained Grey Matter, he loved Four Arms, the least creatively named and most humanoid of the original aliens. A member of the Tetramand species, Four Arms stood 12 feet tall and had super strength and greater endurance than any human, thanks to his huge size and his extra set of arms. As a result, Ben mainly used him against overpowered and larger enemies.

            While his brawn made him useful in a fight, Four Arms was also the most generic of the Ben 10 original aliens, and some of his strengths were made redundant by others in the line-up. His size sometimes worked against him, as Four Arms was not nearly as maneuverable in combat as some of Ben's faster forms. On the other hand, Four Arms had the unique trait of gaining strength with age, making him extremely strong at this point.</p>
