        <h2><u>Abour ghostfreak</u></h2>
        <p>Ghostfreak was the strangest of the original Ben 10 aliens but also incredibly useful. His powers included invisibility, intangibility, and the ability to possess other living beings. This allowed him to pass through the strongest security, even if he needed to become corporeal to actually do anything substantial. Ghostfreak also has access to prehensile tentacles, which come in handy on numerous occasions.</p>
