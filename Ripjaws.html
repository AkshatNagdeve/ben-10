        <p>One of the weakest Ben 10 aliens, Ripjaws was an aquatic alien with a design that looked like a humanoid angler fish. When in water, his legs dissolved into a fishtail, allowing him to swim extremely fast. Ripjaws had one of the most terrifying alien designs in the series, but his abilities came with major drawbacks attached. On the other hand, his jaws were shockingly potent, capable of cutting through solid metal.</p>
